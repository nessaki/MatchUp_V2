## Problem Statement:
People have different body shapes and the online stores rarely address this since the models generally wearing the clothes have perfect figure.

It is difficult to buy apparel online as you haven't tried it yet as you would do so in physical stores. People have different body shapes and the online stores do not address this since the models generally wearing the clothes have perfect figure. Sometimes one company’s sizing chart differs from another and this becomes a hassle while shopping online.
